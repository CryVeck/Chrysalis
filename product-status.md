# Keyboardio Chrysalis

This is a _test release_ of the next version of Chrysalis, the graphical configuration tool for Keyboardio's Kaleidoscope-powered keyboards.

## What doesn't work

- Device disconnect detection
- Loading "pre-configured" layouts
- Backup and restore (outside of flashing)

## What should work

- Changing your layout
- Changing your LED configuration
- Changing device settings
- Loading stock firmware
- Custom firmware updates
- Factory reset

## Device support

- Keyboardio Model 100
- Keyboardio Atreus
- Keyboardio Model 01

_Note:_ On macOS, the Atreus and Model 01 may experience unreliable connectivity with firmware versions before 0.92.1

## Browser support

Chrysalis requires a browser with WebSerial support. Right now, this means Chrome, Edge, Arc, Brave, and other browsers based on Chromium. We're hopeful that Firefox and Apple will implement WebSerial and WebUSB, but neither browser maker has yet announced their intention to do so.
