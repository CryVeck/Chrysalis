# Keyboardio Chrysalis 

This is a *test release* of the next version of Chrysalis, the graphical configuration tool for Keyboardio's Kaleidoscope-powered keyboards. 

## What doesn't work

- Device disconnect detection
- Loading "pre-configured" layouts
- Backup and restore (outside of flashing)

## What should work

- Changing your layout
- Changing your LED configuration
- Changing device settings
- Factory reset
- Custom firmware updates for the Atreus and Model 01
- Loading stock firmware for the Atreus and Model 01

## Device support

- Keyboardio Model 100
- Keyboardio Atreus
- Keyboardio Model 01

*Note:* On macOS, the Atreus and Model 01 may experience unreliable connectivity with firmware versions before 0.92.1

## Browser support

Chrysalis requires a browser with WebSerial support. Right now, this means Chrome, Edge, Arc, Brave, and other browsers based on Chromium. We're hopeful that Firefox and Apple will implement WebSerial and WebUSB, but neither browser maker has yet announced their intention to do so.
