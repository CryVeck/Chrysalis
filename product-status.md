# Chrysalis on the web

This is an *early test release* of the next version of Chrysalis, the graphical configuration tool for Keyboardio's Kaleidoscope-powered keyboards. 

## What doesn't work

- Firmware updates
- Loading "pre-configured" layouts
- Saving app configuration locally
- Device disconnect detection

## What should work

- Changing your layout
- Changing your LED configuration
- Changing device settings
- Factory reset

## Device support

- Keyboardio Model 100
- Keyboardio Atreus
- Keyboardio Model 01

*Note:* On macOS, the Atreus and Model 01 may experience unreliable connectivity with firmware versions before 0.92

## Browser support

Chrysalis requires a browser with WebSerial support. Right now, this means Chrome, Edge, Arc, Brave, and other browsers based on Chromium. We're hopeful that Firefox and Apple will implement WebSerial and WebUSB, but neither browser maker has yet announced their intention to do so.
